I have a BFA from Pratt Institute for Fashion Design and half of a master's degree's worth of work in Costume History.  On a whim, I decided to persue cosmetology too, and I also am graduate of the Marinello School of Beauty School in California. (Licensed in two states!)  All of this was well before I embarked on the Full Stack Web Development fellowship at the Flatiron School though.</p> <p>The takeaway is that with my varietied backgound I've been transferring my creativity to a different medium.  Web Development happens to make me the happiest though.</p>",
    "workCopy": "<p>But enough about me, let me tell you about my work.</p><p>My most recent position was at Fast Company.  There I worked as a front end developer. I was part of a team that went through two design refreshes as well as a stack update.  I also created multiple client side components for our family of sites including:  Innovation By Design awards, Most Innovative Companies awards, and our breaking news and opinion site, FastCo. News.</p><p>Prior to that, I was a developer at ESPN on their ad production team.  I helped bring ad campaigns to fruition, troubleshot malfunctioning code and also created internal tools for our account managers’ lives easier.</p><p>I also have worked for two Rails based dev shops, The Maki Fund and Wizard Development.</p>"

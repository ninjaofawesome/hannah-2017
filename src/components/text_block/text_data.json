It.</p>  <p>I've always been a creative person, no matter what the medium.  I have a BFA from Pratt Institute for Fashion Design, which led me down a path where I was at one point pursuing a Masters degree in Costume History from the Fashion Institute of Technology (incomplete).  I also am graduate of the Marinello School of Beauty School in California.  This is all well before my fellowship at the Flatiron School though.</p>",

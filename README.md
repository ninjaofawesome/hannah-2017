# Hannah 2017 React Portfolio

## What is this?

I periodically like to update my portfolio as my skillset increases, either technically or chronologically.  This is the most current iteration, built in React.

I consider it a work in progress.

## How do I use this?

1. clone or fork this repo.
2. `cd` into the directory, type `npm i` and hit enter.
3. once the repository has installed, type `npm start` and hit enter.
4. Behold the genius.

## Where can I see this?

Currently its offline.  However, you can view the previous version of my portfolio [here](http://hereshannahs.info/).
